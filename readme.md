### Ans
Ill use swiper js

- Ease of use: Swiper JS is a library that is specifically designed for creating carousels, so it provides a lot of built-in functionality that can be difficult and time-consuming to replicate using vanilla JavaScript.

- Responsiveness: Swiper JS is designed to be fully responsive, meaning that it will automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes and device types. This can be difficult to achieve with pure JavaScript, especially for developers who are not experienced with responsive design.

- Performance: Swiper JS is designed to be lightweight and fast, which can be important for creating a smooth user experience. It also includes advanced features like lazy loading and preloading that can help optimize performance.

- Customization: Swiper JS provides a lot of options for customization, including different types of slides, navigation controls, and pagination. While it is possible to customize these features using vanilla JavaScript, it can be time-consuming and difficult to get the same level of functionality and flexibility as with Swiper JS.

Overall, using Swiper JS can save developers a lot of time and effort when creating carousels, while also providing a more responsive and performant user experience.
